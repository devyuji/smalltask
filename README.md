# SmallTask - Take small steps to achieve big things.

Have you ever felt that when you are working on a project you kinda get confused about what to do? Which one should I do first? I always get that so I built a small task manager app that lets you create 5 tasks and set a time for it. The default is (60 mins.). And vola! Work on those tasks.

## Try out the app
